# moonshot
Screenshots with Selenium.

Just specify a list websites to capture, and at which window resolutions for each.

Etymology: *Selenium* comes from the Greek *selēnē* (*σελήνη*) meaning *moon*. We take *shot*s of screens. Hence, *moon*-*shot*, or *moonshot*. 

There are many tools based purely on [PhantomJS], which unfortunately hasn't been great at rendering web fonts.
By using Selenium, we can get screenshots from any supported browser that look exactly as they would appear to real users.
